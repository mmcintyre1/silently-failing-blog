Growing up, apparently I adored Winnie the Pooh. I loved it like any infant loves anything; it was there, fluffy, and brightly colored. By the time I had any say in the matter, the momentum of sentimentality had swept me up, and I was awash with dolls and loving anecdotes about my doting affection to said dolls. As an adult, I find the affable bear *cumbersome* sometimes -- he is just so obtuse.

The same might be said about this book, composed of two of Hoff's novels, *The Tao of Pooh* and the *Te of Piglet*, written ten years apart. There is a way of the universe, and contentment is becoming one with that way through action without intention. I don't want to review the tenets of Taoism other than to say while Hoff explicitly states that Taoism doesn't espouse passivity, it certainly seems to like wearing all it's clothing. There's plenty of fodder in the novel itself, from the meandering pacing to the completely out of left field attacks on politically correct culture and the 'war on chivalry'. There is a certain undertone to the politically-laced chapters from the *Te of Piglet* that recalls the same populist arguments we have heard over the last four years in America, and for a Taoist Hoff borders on the downright angry at times in those chapters.

If there are villains in the 100 Acre Woods, they are certainly found in Clever Rabbit, Wise Owl, and Dismal Eeyore. In contrast, there is Winnie the Pooh of the Eternal Present. While Rabbit is too clever for his own good, Pooh lets the way of the universe take him wherever it may go. Forgotten in this novel, though, is how often Pooh finds himself at Rabbit's house looking for food because he has none of his own. Someone needs to peek into the Distant Future, I suppose.
