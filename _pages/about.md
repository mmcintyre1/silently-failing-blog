This is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I can't guarantee I'll be in here in a year, or a month, and if you wanted to look through some of my old repositories, I'm clearly steeped in the stop-start engine sputter of project sprawl. Time to write a blog turns into what should I implement it in only plebeians use WordPress, I'm a Real Programmer, I should learn React but I guess I also need to learn Webpack but I'm also rubbish at CSS and apparently I need to learn Babel to transpile JS so it is compatible across browsers and what the hell is Koa or React Redux whatever and then after I copy and paste tutorial code and have a working site I grafted from someone elses creativity I need to figure out where to host this and might as well play around with load balancers and managed databases and then holy shit this would cost a billion dollars to stand up and I haven't even implemented a CMS and oh look, anything that isn't this, let me literally never touch this code again. The road to hell is paved with partially implemented blogs in shiny new frameworks.

And another thing: the world needs me. Rather, I need the world to need me. I'm sure the site traffic will dispel any notion that I have compelling things to say or could capture an online audience, but until that illusion comes crashing down and swallows me in an existential tidal wave, I have convinced myself that just one more blog filled with tech musings, SEO-optimized post titles, raving book reviews, and borrowed tutorials is what this troubled world needs. Because I have the answer, I have seen the light, and another résumé masquerading as a blog is it.
