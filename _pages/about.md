## about the site
This is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I can't guarantee I'll be here studiously typing away my thoughts in a year, or a month, and if you wanted to look through some of my old repositories, I'm no stranger to the sputtering engine of project sprawl. Time to write a blog turns into what should I implement it in only plebeians use WordPress, I'm a Real Programmer, I should learn React but I guess I also need to learn Webpack but I'm also rubbish at CSS and apparently I need to learn Babel to transpile JS so it is compatible across browsers and what the hell is Koa or React Redux whatever I just need to start let me copy paste tutorial code and have a working site that's grafted directly from someone else's creativity but now I need to figure out where to host this and might as well play around with load balancers and managed databases and last time I used AWS let's try Digital Ocean and then holy shit this would cost a billion dollars to stand up and I haven't even implemented a CMS and oh look, literally anything that isn't this let me literally never touch this code again. The road to hell is paved with partially implemented blogs in shiny new frameworks. This time I tried the GitHub Pages and jekyll route, so let's keep this train rolling!

And another thing: the world needs me. Rather, I need the world to need me. I'm sure the site traffic will dispel any saccharine notion that I have compelling things to say or could capture an online audience, but until that illusion comes crashing down and swallows me in an existential tidal wave, I have convinced myself that just one more blog filled with tech musings, SEO-optimized post titles, raving book reviews, and borrowed tutorials is what this troubled world needs. Because I have the answer, I have seen the light, and another résumé masquerading as a blog is it.

## about me
I like writing overly complicated and inaccessible sentences, reading, learning new things, opening things up to see how they work and struggling to put them back together again and I can't reconcile my strong and public opinion on the need for an oxford comma with my actions.
