### State of the Race

All right. Hot out of the gate. I'm no mathematician (despite my protestations that I like to count), but 6 isn't going to cut it. 737,000 words isn't too bad -- it works out to about 50 hours of reading at a 250 WPM clip. One of the things I never got was how people read so damn quickly. I've heard a bunch of different methods, to avoid sub-vocalizing words in your head, to plug things into a speed reader device, to use a marker, but those things either reduce comprehension to next to nothing or make the reading into some high stakes ocular calisthenics, the-sitting-on-your-couch-without-moving-for-hours-on-end version of *Man on Wire*. Who needs that stress?

Need a more respectable 8 a month to keep on pace.

### Books?
Anyway, this month there were a few bookshelf oldies (my term for the lifers on my 'to-read' bookshelf) and a few, uh, newies. I got in the habit of trying to read a particular years Pulitzer, National Book Award Winners, Hugos, and Nebulas (can we call it a habit if this is literally the first time I've tried?), and *A Song for A New Day* was the first of that crop. It was all right. Followed that up with a stinker in *Together: How to Stretch a Single Bullet Point into a Book*. It's probably not fair to call any book a stinker; it takes real dedication to write a book, a Dr. Murthy is a compelling figure, but the book was just cripplingly boring. I normally read sitting up, because when I lay down I'm prone to naps, but this book might've put me to sleep standing.

Moving on. The biggest surprise of my life is that I haven't read more of Nabokov. In the the hopelessly reductive categorization of literary geeks, you have sentence people and story people, or, people who love a good sentence above all else, and then there are those who are compelled by story alone. I am firmly in the sentence camp, an allegiance that would fix me assuredly in the ranks of faithful readers of Nabokov. The man shits better English sentences than I've ever written in my entire life. But I had, up to this point, only read *Lolita*, which, after reading *Pale Fire*, is a crime. His stories move like David Lynch movies and his prose flows like Willy Wonka's chocolate river. One thing is for sure, this won't be the only Nabakov novel this year. After I put it down, I hurriedly went to Amazon (sponsorship opportunity?) and put his entire *ouevre* in my cart. Yee-haw.

### Other odds and ends
- liberal democracy is the end of the line
- homo sapiens are historically closer to atilla the hun than gandhi
- No tech book this month :(

### Nice new words
