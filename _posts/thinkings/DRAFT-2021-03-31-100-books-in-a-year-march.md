watching the marvel cinematic universe because I am 6 years behind the zeitgeist and I just want to feel part of something. A lot of super heroes are just outrageous propaganda. Captain America.
generic movie tropes bingo:
- love interest walks in while hero is (often unwillingly) being kissed by rival
- outrageously large strong guy enters the scene, the hero wallops him a few times to no effect -- bonus points if outrageously strong guy is defeated easily by some surprising device
- many characters arguing in the background, one character in the foreground staring off past the camera at something peculiar or frightening, all while say guys louder and louder until they scream it and background characters stop arguing to see the peculiar thing
