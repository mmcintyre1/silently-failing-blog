I spent a significant part of this month watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in chronological order, one a day like a battering ram against my skull. I don't know why I started other than a perverse act of performance; I've always thought the movies were exceptionally mediocre, but like in a really offensive way. Either that, or I am just perpetually 6 years behind the *zeitgeist* and just want to feel part of something.

I got up to *Age of Ultron* in which James Spader is an all powerful AI of mysterious origins, tasked with delivering perpetual peace to the blood-stained hands of humanity, and, you guessed it, decides the only way to effect that is to bring about the complete annihilation of the human race. These movies feel written by checklist. 90% of the effort is guessing the bad guy, who, surprise, was actually the good guy from the beginning. The good guys are just so good, the bad guys so bad, the property damage so gratuitous. I'm fascinated by the mediocrity. I started writing a movie bingo card. All of these things happen **multiple** times across the movies.

- female love interest poorly times walking in while male character is being kissed by female rival. extra tile: male character says 'its not what it looks like!'
- outrageously large, strong guy enters the scene, hero wallops him a few times to no effect. extra tile: outrageously strong guy is defeated easily by some surprising device like a gun or a fire extinguisher upside the head
- many characters arguing in the background, one character in the foreground staring off past the camera at something peculiar or frightening. character in the foreground says guys louder and louder until they scream guys and background characters stop arguing to see the peculiar thing.
- bad guy issues ultimatum after taking over ALL tv stations. extra tile: there is a shot of someone trying to change the channel like the inept, gray character pratfalling in late night cable commercials, demonstrating the outrageous difficulty of some inane task by trying to like kick milk out of a jug into a precariously balanced cereal bowl, three quarters of it, the bowl of cereal that is, hanging over the edge anyway and you'd swear it'd fall on its own without the bungling pilates routine, but the channel can't be changed.
- good guy is actually bad guy
- universe that is impossibly futuristic with amazing science and still fights with spears and swords and fists
- hawkeye is useless. honestly though I'm not sure what is less powerful in the marvel universe: hawkeye or bullets

I hope the bad guy wins every movie.

### reading is for winners

All right, enough of modern day super heroes. How about ancient Grecian super heroes? I finally read Edith Hamilton's *Mythology*. It's been on my kindle&trade; forever and I've made various attempts at running it through with next to no success. Well worth the read. Hamilton's work is well-sourced, and it feels a bit like reading Grimm's Fairy Tales compared to the disney thefts, which is to say these myths and stories are not PG rated. The gods were all pretty much awful. Like Hawkeye awful. Hamilton throws in a taster at the end of the Norse gods, and it turns out those guys and gals were pretty all right.

I had a hard time keeping up with reviews this month, so my last few were **not** great. I resorted to speaking in incomplete sentences and smattering the page with poorly articulated bullet points.

`#TODO: write better`

Maybe by the time anyone reads this, I'll have updated the entries, or this blog might be bundled up on usbs and stuck in some salt mine to languish until the heat death of the universe as part of a github preservation project. Maybe some alien civilization with the technology to replicate a being from their written text will stumble upon the usbs and painstakingly recreate my consciousness just so I can explain myself for that absolutely outrageous sentence about informercials above.

I did clean up some older books on the shelf in *Mythology*, *Manufacturing Consent*, and *Denial of Death*, and I removed some other books from the shelf with the intention of reading them soon, so maybe half credit there. They are sitting on various surfaces to give my home the air of the 'well-read'. It's not enough to read books, you have to tell everyone how many books you read. Book peacocking. Making sure your work camera picks up your bookcase, carefully positioned book titles flaunting their spines promenading the type of intellectual company you keep.

One of the books that will stick with me though is *Interior Chinatown* -- I have read a few articles about the emasculation of the asian man, but I hadn't really given much thought to the existentially homeless asian person, the one who is denied that still second class hyphenated *american* suffix, the one who is only ever 'asian', the one who came from parents who were more American than I could ever hope to be and yet will never be thought of on reflex as American. *Manufacturing Consent* picks up this continued fiction of America, the one told in myths and narrative and subverted media reporting. A lot of March's books can be read as unveilings of the mythopoeia of America and shared human reality; one might come away with a strong feeling that reality is a socially constructed forest we swing from tree to tree in and narrative weaves the harness that safeguards a plunge into oblivion.

I also read two tech books, and that was dandy.
