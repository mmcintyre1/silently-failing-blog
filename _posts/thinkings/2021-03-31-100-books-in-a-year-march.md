I spent a significant part of this month watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in chronological order. I don't know why I started other than a perverse act of performance; I've always thought the movies were exceptionally mediocre in a really offensive way. Either that, or I am just perpetually 6 years behind the *zeitgeist* and just want to feel part of something.

Regardless, I got up to *Age of Ultron* in which James Spader is a mysterious and all powerful AI that has been tasked with bringing about perpetual peace, and, you guessed it, decides the only way to effect that is to bring about the complete elimination of all humans. These movies feel written by checklist. 90% of the effort is guessing the bad guy, who, surprise, was actually the good guy from the beginning. It's just all cut and dry ultra good and ultra bad people inflicting property damage. I started writing a movie bingo card. These all happen **multiple** times in the marvel cinematic universe.

- female love interest poorly times walking in while male character is kissing female rival. related tile: male character says 'its not what it looks like!'
- outrageously large strong guy enters the scene, the hero wallops him a few times to no effect. related tile: outrageously strong guy is defeated easily by some surprising device like a gun or a fire extinguisher upside the head
- many characters arguing in the background, one character in the foreground staring off past the camera at something peculiar or frightening. character in the foreground says guys louder and louder until screaming and background characters stop arguing to see the peculiar thing.
- bad guy issues ultimatum after taking over ALL tv stations. related tile: there is a shot of someone trying to change the channel like the people in infomercials who need to demonstrate the difficulty of a task by spilling soda while sitting down or bang their head tying their shoes
- good guy is actually bad guy
- universe that is impossibly futuristic with amazing science and still fights with spears and swords and fists
- hawkeye is useless

I hope the bad guy wins every movie.

### reading is for winners

All right, enough of modern day super heroes. How about ancient Grecian super heroes? I finally read Edith Hamilton's *Mythology*. It's been on my kindle&trade; forever and I've made various attempts at running it through with next to no success. I had a hard time keeping up with reviews this month, so my last few were **not** great. I resorted to speaking in incomplete sentences and smattering the page with poorly articulated bullet points.

`#TODO: write better`

I did clean up some older books on the shelf in *Mythology*, *Manufacturing Consent*, and *Denial of Death*, and I removed some other books from the shelf with the intention of reading them soon, so maybe half credit there. They are sitting on various surfaces to give my home the air of the 'well-read'. It's not enough to read books, you have to tell everyone how many books you read. Book peacocking. Making sure your work camera picks up your bookcase, with its carefully positioned book titles conveying the message of who you want to be seen as.


### other odds and ends
- Where was Hercules murdering his entire family in the Disney movie?
- The star cluster Pleiades is called **Subaru** in Japanese. My first car as a Pleiades Impreza.
- The United States Government spends ~1 billion on PR, [and more than half of that is from the Pentagon](https://reason.com/2016/10/10/the-pentagon-accounts-for-more-than-half/).
