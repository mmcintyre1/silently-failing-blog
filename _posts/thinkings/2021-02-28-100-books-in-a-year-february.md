This month was a poor showing. I got myself a Playstation 5 and was frankly surprised by how easy it was to get. I didn't have any games to play, so I ended up playing *Horizon Zero Dawn*. I had originally gotten about 34% of the way through, but shortly after it came out, my then girlfriend, another strong red-headed woman from a foreign land, had come to America to live, and my playtime fell off. This time, I was going to play it through.

### Books?
I remarked upon this in the review, but *The Tao of Pooh* got weirdly political, with a whole diatribe against chivalry and political correctness, which feels somewhat out of place for an eastern mysticism sort of thing, and certainly an odd interlude between two LGBT authors. I guess I just don't truck with that eastern mysticism of the eternal present.
