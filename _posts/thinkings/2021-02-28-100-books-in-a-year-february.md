Woof. Not a great month. If my love of RPGs and this entire endeavor is any indication, I love when the numbers get bigger, and the numbers did **not** get bigger this month. I blame it on the Playstation 5. I kept hearing finding one was as hard as finding Robert DeNiro's acting dignity the last 10 years. No one had one. Silicon was out of stock from the local silicon mines, and maybe this is China's fault or something. But did Robert DeNiro give up after *Little Fockers*? He sure as hell did not, firing off a trifecta of shit in *Last Vegas*, *The Intern*, and *Dirty Grandpa*. So would I let a little trade war with China deter me? Hell no, I was going to get myself a Playstation 5. I followed the twitter folks, hell, I made a twitter (doesn't matter when you are reading this, my twitter account probably still has one terrible tweet), lined up all the rows, shot down all the ducks, and proceeded to get a Playstation 5 pretty much first try.

I caught the car, but didn't have anything to play, so I went to an old reliable that I hadn't finished when it first came out, *Horizon Zero Dawn*, released when the video game industry was setting out to prove that woman can be homocidal mass murdering maniac protagonists just as well as men could be. Couple that all with a handful of not so great books in a row, and you get a month where I'm pumping stats with the *Tao Te Ching*, which is about as long as a diner menu and nearly as interesting.

But let's not let that painfully uninteresting and discursive introduction let me off the hook for all the wonderful and clarifying things I'm going to say about this month's books, the insights I'll glean, the narratives I'll weave, as if all the books were working together in some larger narrative, some meta-narrative. I think there is probably a spectrum here that these synopses will take from LiveJournal to dissertation, and this month is firmly in the LiveJournal camp. Anyway, let's get this over with.

### Books?
I remarked upon this in the review, but *The Tao of Pooh* got weirdly political, with a whole diatribe against chivalry and political correctness, which feels somewhat out of place for an eastern mysticism sort of thing, and certainly an odd interlude between two LGBT authors. I guess I just don't truck with that eastern mysticism of the eternal present, this idea that if you could cast of the reins of oppressive past and looming future, you can be Eternally Here&trade;, although I haven't found a ton of fulfillment working away for the looming future, so what the hell do I know. My one adage is to be good at what you do.

Speaking of good at what one does, I read another Harari book this month, *Homo Deus*. I really enjoy the man's ethos, if not where it might lead. The basic premise is humankind does one thing better than any other animal, and this is use fiction to describe reality. From this drive, all intersubjective reality rests; religion, government, capitalism, enmity and amity. Built on top of these intersubjective superstructures are the very real buildings and guns and tanks and physical apparatus of beliefs, but ultimately, all that physical presence relies on the communal agreement to their significance. *Homo Deus* seems to be in an interesting dialogue with liberalist thinkers like Dawkins and Pinker (and by extension Fukuyama and his end of history) in his [Harari's] claim that if there is no self there can't be any liberalism. It is a brand of purposeful nihilism, something flirting with the margins and edges of meaninglessness. I find it quite compelling. Its fun to deconstruct things like thought, self, soul, consistent being. Reminds me of Whitman. Section 51 from *Leaves of Grass* is too good (and short enough) to include in full:

```
The past and present wilt—I have fill'd them, emptied them.
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.

Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)

Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.

Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his supper?
Who wishes to walk with me?

Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?
```

### Favorite Quote
> This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But some freedom is better than none.

*Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari*
