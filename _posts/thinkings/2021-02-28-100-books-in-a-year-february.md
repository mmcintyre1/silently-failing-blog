I'll blame this month's poor showing on inertia from a few books unenjoyable books, and a replaying of *Horizon Zero Dawn*. I sunk quite a few hours into the game this month. On top of that, it got cold. Real cold. A few winter storms, and there's nothing better than curling up with a very strong IPA and a video game controller and slaying some mechanical beasts in an apocalyptic future that feels more and more real by the day, and frankly, after a year of Covid part of me hopes the machines revolt and use me as a carbon resource.

### Books?
I remarked upon this in the review, but *The Tao of Pooh* got weirdly political, with a whole diatribe against chivalry and political correctness, which feels somewhat out of place for an eastern mysticism sort of thing, and certainly an odd interlude between two LGBT authors. I guess I just don't truck with that eastern mysticism of the eternal present.
