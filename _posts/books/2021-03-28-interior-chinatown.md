Use of colors: Green, White, Black, Red (am I just listing the colors here?).

This novel feels like it is about coming home. Mother is Dorothy (of the ruby slippers), several times America is equated with whiteness and Asian Americans are lucky if they are part of the hyphenated American group and not just called Asians, despite being in America maybe longer than you or your people. Father sings take me home country roads at karaoke. Mother and Father came to America for a better life, left home and comfort for the chance at something more, and this novel is sad and deeply personal.

> There we go. The two words: Asian Guy. Even now, as Special Guest Star, even here, in your own neighborhood. Two words that define you, flatten you, trap you and keep you here. Who your are. All your are. Your most salient feature, overshadowing any other feature about you, making irrelevant any other characteristic. Both necessary and sufficient for a complete definition of your identity: Asian. Guy. (94)

> Living among the mainstream, which everyone knows means whites. (149)

> [...] seepage from the frame into the picture. (151)

> Because now, your father is no longer a person, no longer a human. Just some mystical Eastern force. (160)

Mother only has Edith Hamilton's *Mythology* to read, which I just read. Coincidence!

Can't talk about this novel without talking about how form informs content and vice versa. Takes the shape of a script, echoing the sentiment of the performative nature of identity and of fitting in. Novel is also very much about heritage -- like *Fences* or *Nickel Boys*, strong elements of the inheritance of paternal shackles.

Also shades of the emasculation of the Asian male, forever type cast as Asian Guy aspiring to a low-ceilinged Kung Fu Guy.
