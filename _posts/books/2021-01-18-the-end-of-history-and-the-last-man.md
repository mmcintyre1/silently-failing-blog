#### Hegel, Marx, and Neitzche, walk into a bar...
Postmodernism is the end of everything, the disbanding of the mythos of human culture for the last two thousand years, culminating in a mass exodus into the unreality of the real, the place where humanity is a social animal that learned self-control and built fictional structures to perpetuate that . As a species we've either outgrown the need for the myth (God is dead), or the myth has reached an equilibrium free of dialectical contradictions (liberal democracy). This work falls into the latter camp.

Fukuyama never quite delivers on the bombast of the title, hiding and hedging behind other's philosophical arguments, but the book is important. In the 20 plus years since it's publication, it's central thesis of history as an evolution ending with liberal democracy is all the more validated, and offers a good (and approachable) dialogue between some of history's most prescient thinkers in Kant, Hegel, Marx, Rousseau, Locke, etc. It is easy to be compelled by this dialogue, and the narrative Fukuyama builds from them.

It's not without its misses though -- it's easy to circle in red ink the misses of a book proclaiming the end of history, a book of prophecy. Chief among the concerns is that Fukuyama isn't a technologist, and I don't think the full story of world culture within the last 30 years can be told without mentioning the effect of the internet. Also, Fukuyama misses the rise of anocracies (Russia, the appeal of Donald Trump). Wikipedia tells me that from 1989 to 2013, the number of anocracies increased from 30 to 53.

Regardless, it *is* an important work and deserving of the attention.
