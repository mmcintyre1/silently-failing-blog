> Some people build fences to keep people out and other people build fences to keep people in. Rose wants to hold on to you all. She loves you.

In many ways, this play feels like a retelling of *Death of a Salesman* with a white Loman transposed for a black Maxson. Both plots spiral around the same infidelity, the same failure of masculinity, the same illusory wool of the American Dream to be pulled away from the eyes, the same very real American death, leaving those still left to square away how long the shadow of his remains is cast. While in *Fences*, Troy has success in petitioning his boss to rectify the inequities he has experienced making him a garbage truck driver where Willy fails utterly, both are still ground into dust.

While *Death of a Salesman* was a quintessentially white story, *Fences* adds race to the admixture, making the argument that culture, or capitalism's reification, has de-masculinized the black man, and a ladder only has as many rungs as your father might give you, your bootstraps only as much lift as the long history of fathers and sons that came before you might allow. We can build a fence to keep it out or keep what we love in, but you can't stay fenced in forever.
