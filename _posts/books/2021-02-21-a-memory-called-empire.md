Every time I'm out, science fiction pulls me back in. Is it that if you affix enough space-age gadgetry to a soap opera it makes it somehow cool and totally not something to watch at 11 AM on a Tuesday between glasses of wine number 2 and 3? Has nerd gone the full circle another time and become chic again? Or is it because science fiction at its best, in throwing out plausibility and in relegating the constraints of reality, of taxes and death and the churn of workaday existence to an afterthought, allows for a world that exists as a toy problem, as a snow globe narrowly encompassing plot, that allows for a more concentrated inquiry into a particular facet of humanity? It doesn't matter that it might not be possible to implant a device into your brain stem to carry someone elses memories with you; the real importance is what this might say about what the self is and what effect memory has in forming that self.

> So much of who we are is what we remember and retell [...]

Looking at this novel's composite pieces, it is at first a space opera in the immediate tradition, as my jacket blurb mentions, of Ann Leckie and Yoon Ha Lee, but it feels natural to draw longer lines to Lois McMaster Bujold and her Vor court, and especially Cordelia's fish out of water can-doism. The intrigue is postured as a murder investigation by Mahit, the newly-minted ambassador from the mining outpost of Lsel, who has arrived to the city shining on a hill of Teixcalaan upon the politically rife death of her predecessor, who's years delayed memory implant she wears straddled to her brain stem. Martine's postdoctoral research was in Byzantine studies, and that is reflected in both the plot and the names of locales, and in murmuring them while I read they certainly take trips around the mouth. I ended up shortening things to their First Letter quite often. Who has time to bumper car their way through a sesquipedalian smattering of multi-syllabic proper nouns. And while I'm on the subject of criticisms (there is so much in this book to praise that I might as well group these piddling complaints together to get them out of the way), I really hope Martine's editor is a little more heavy-handed in disallowing italics. Not every sentence needs an italicized emphasis. I found my inner monologue got quite the workout, and interesting enough it seems like when a word is italicized it means you take the enunciation and roll it down and up a hill again like silly putty.

The self, like the soul or the mind, is another casualty of modernity. Are we a continuous whole, or is the self just a *post hoc* justification of the algorithmic endocrine response, the reptile brain intermingled with what liberal humanism assures us is a higher functioning thought? The novel's dramatic tension is resolved with self unifying with other, with a *less* defunct Yksandr joining the self of Mahit, but the moral seems a bit less clear. The dialectical pattern of self and other, of T-land (I can't spell it any better than I can say it) and Lsel, of Three Seagrass and Mahit, of past and present, of empire and of memory, is writ all over the novel, and these battles form the propulsion of the novel.

Maybe this is what good science fiction is all about. I certainly look forward to the sequel.
