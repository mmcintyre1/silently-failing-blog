What keeps bringing me back to science fiction? Is it the world-building, or the techno-patina that makes the soap operatic intrigue palatable? Is it because science fiction novels when they are at their best, in relegating the constraints of reality, of taxes and death and the churn of workaday existence, to a sidebar, allows for a world that exists as a toy problem, as a snow globe narrowly scoped to plot, that allows for a more concentrated inquiry into a particular facet of humanity? It doesn't matter that it might not be possible to implant a device into your brain stem to carry someone else's memories with you; the real importance is what this might say about what the self is and what effect memory has in forming that self.

Looking at this novel's composite pieces, it is at first a space opera in the immediate tradition, as my jacket blurb mentions, of Ann Leckie and Yoon Ha Lee, but it feels natural to draw longer lines to Lois McMaster Bujold and her Vor court. The intrigue is postured as a murder investigation by Mahit, the newly-minted ambassador from the mining outpost of Lsel, who has arrived to the city shining on a hill of Teixcalaan upon the politically rife death of her predecessor, who's years delayed memory implant she wears straddled to her brain stem.
