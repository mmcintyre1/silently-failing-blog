> Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.

Self-help is a crowded field, and it mostly feels filled with painfully confident men who pad a small bulleted list into a full-size novel like they are being paid by the word. The formula is the same -- begin with an anecdote that seems impossible to solve, then drop your *deus ex machina* solution to fix your hypothetical problem like you didn't invent the whole damn thing and you couldn't have resolved your problem equally as well by advocating eating banana peels or doing jumping jacks while drinking coffee and writing a self-help book. Most of these books feel like job applications to speaking tours at Fortune 500 companies, and let's be honest, the 'help' generally boils down to the same few tenets of being nice to people, active listening, stop being a piece of shit, etc.

Atomic Habits feels better than that. It feels like the book I would write if I were any good at this whole writing thing. It is immensely practical, for starters, and Clear lays out real advice for how to adopt habits. In the few weeks since I've read it, I've been able to keep up flossing through habit stacking, or appending a habit you want onto a habit you have like a remora on a shark. I walk the dogs at lunch. Do it every day. So now I floss before I walk the dogs. Just like that.

The other tangible thing I've begun doing is 'resetting' a room before leaving; my partner mocks me, but everything is much cleaner. If only the dogs would heed the advice and stop shedding toy and hair alike everywhere.

Clear has a model for how humans form habits and from here he has outlined rules for how to form a habit. You can conveniently reverse them to undo a habit (although you can never erase those pathways forever):
1. cue (make it obvious)
2. craving (make it attractive)
3. response (make it easy)
4. reward (make it satsifying)

I haven't had a chance to explicitly try this out, but I think I subconsciously followed this outline to quit smoking. Not leaving the house because of a Covid quarantine helps.
