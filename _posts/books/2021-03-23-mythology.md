excerpt: All My (Grecian) Children.
---
Turns out, the Greeks and Romans were pretty much just like us. They loved their soaps. Their godly dramas, tragic heroes, the arboricultural end to most fleeing maidens and the spear-tipped demise of charging warriors. There are a few lenses to glance these stories from -- we can view them as the mythic, the allegorical and explanatory, at first documenting a reason for causes of nature, or we can view them as pure entertainment, serving no mythopoetic cause other than to delight. We can view through the prism of the gods and tragic heroes the Greek and Roman worldview, their values and ethics and culture, and its easy to draw the line from modern, western sensibilities and those of 5,000 years ago. Nationalism, fealty, chivalry, courage, heroism in service of your nation or house -- these haven't changed.

### other thoughts
- Various countenances of gods because Greek and Roman peoples were conquering nations and Zeus likely took on various aspects of the main gods of the conquered.
- Throughout, you can see Hamilton's steady hand, lending an air of artifice in the composition but also marshaling the voices of those long gone to tell the stories they spent their lives telling.
- Vindictive gods, would turn everyone into trees or rape everything.
- Story of Phaeton, the Sun god's child, exacting a promise from the Sun god gets to ride in his golden chariot with predictable results.
- Zeus and Hera playing out the trope of henpecked husband who can't help himself we see in so many sitcoms. Surprising how modern it feels.
- Pleiades, seven sisters and children of Atlas who killed themselves and became stars. In Red Hot Chili Peppers song *Can't Stop*.
- Might go back to Keats or Shelley or Woodsworth or Blake and read their poetry now. They all wrote heavily of Greek tragedy.
