excerpt: All My (Grecian) Children.
---

Turns outs, the Greeks and Romans had very modern sensibilities.

Various countenances of gods because Greek and Roman peoples were conquering nations and Zeus likely took on various aspects of the main gods of the conquered.

Throughout, you can see Hamilton's steady hand, lending an air of artifice in the composition but also marshaling the voices of those long gone to tell the stories they spent their lives telling.

Vindictive gods, would turn everyone into trees or rape everything.

Story of Phaeton, the Sun god's child, exacting a promise from the Sun god gets to ride in his golden chariot with predictable results.

What do these stories say about Greek ideals -- national pride, duty, fealty, courage, heroism, stay within your lane.

Zeus and Hera playing out the trope of henpecked husband who can't help himself we see in so many sitcoms. Surprising how modern it feels.

Pleiades, seven sisters and children of Atlas who killed themselves and became stars. In Red Hot Chili Peppers song *Can't Stop*.

Go back to Keats or Shelley or Woodsworth or Blake and read their poetry now. They all wrote heavily of Greek tragedy.
