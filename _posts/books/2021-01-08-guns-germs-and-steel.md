This book still feels timely stepping into 2021, and it's still a largely helpful refresher to fight against the racist ideology of racial determinism. We have seen a human institution in American Republicanism and Trumpism argue in subtle (and often deafening-clarion-loud) tones the tenets of racial determinism to demonize the other, and a lazy mind stops questioning at the first cause (it may be that the most important takeaway from this book is that a rigorous interrogation of causes unveils deeper, and often contradictory to the initial assessment, truth). White power at it's core is wrapped up in the white race's inherent exceptionalism when the reality belies any racial exceptionalism, and this book serves as a potent argument against the historical interpretation.

The book can be dry and Diamond is actually at his best, if not most scientific, when he is imparting a metaphor or using narrative. In particular, the beginning to Chapter 3 involves a dramatic retelling of Pizarro's kidnapping of Atahualpa by reconstructing primary source tellings. Other times, like on the sixtieth retelling of how a particular region didn't have access to domesticable animals or plants, parachute the books momentum, although his application of his food production thesis across all continents is a compelling telling.

Insofar as the Pulitzer is a mark of quality (I certainly am not in a place to comment on deservedness of the award compared to the competition), this book is a worthwhile entry.
