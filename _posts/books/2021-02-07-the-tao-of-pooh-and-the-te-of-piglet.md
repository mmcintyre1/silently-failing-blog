Growing up, apparently I adored Winnie the Pooh. I loved it like any infant loves anything; it was there, fluffy, and brightly colored. By the time I had any say in the matter, the momentum of sentimentality had swept me up, and I was awash with dolls and loving anecdotes about my doting affection to said dolls. As an adult, I find the affable bear *cumbersome* sometimes -- he is just so obtuse.

The same might be said about this book, composed of two of Hoff's novels, *The Tao of Pooh* and the *Te of Piglet*, written ten years apart. The books play as user guides to lived Taoism through Winnie the Pooh and Piglet (the Pig? the Pooh? the Robbin?), and it is filled to the brim of those far East reversal platitudes that have been repeated so often in popular culture as to become memes. Learning is unlearning, being is unbeing, wax on, wax off, you know the lines. I don't want to review the tenets of Taoism other than to say while Hoff explicitly states that Taoism doesn't espouse passivity, it certainly seems to like wearing all passivity's clothing, going on about town dressed as passivity, signing checks with passivity's name, etc. There's plenty of fodder in the novel itself, from the meandering pacing to the completely out of left field attacks on politically correct culture and the 'war on chivalry'. There is a certain undertone to the politically-laced chapters from the *Te of Piglet* that recalls the same populist arguments we have heard over the last four years in America, and for a Taoist Hoff borders on the downright angry at times in those chapters.

If there are villains in the 100 Acre Woods, they are certainly found in Clever Rabbit, Wise Owl, and Dismal Eeyore. In contrast, there is Winnie the Pooh of the Eternal Present, the lovable, affable, lovably affable bear. While Rabbit is too clever for his own good, Pooh lets the way of the universe take him wherever it may go (just make sure you have some honey lying around -- someone who is eternally present so frequently has no food of their own). Where Owl is studious and lost in his books, Pooh reads the text of the Universe. Where Eeyore is a pessimist, constantly bemoaning how the universe has let him down, Pooh doesn't expect of the universe, for it just is. It seems Hoff took the directive to heart; the novel meandering from chapter to chapter like one prong of its two-headed source material, the *Tao Te Ching*. I can't help but think the book club psychology could've been distilled to a bulleted list to save us all the effort.
