While the material in this book is compelling if at first glance (this certainly isn't the first book to warn of the detrimental effects loneliness has on health), it is so stutteringly arranged as to make it aggressively dull. There were dozens of times when reading this book that I found myself two or three pages downstream with no recollection of how I got there. There is no logical grouping of themes into chapters, Murthy uses personal anecdote far less frequently than he should (his story framing the most compelling bits of the book), and the books prime arguments against loneliness (and for togetherness) are lost in the flat-wheel gait of pacing. It's a shame, as the book bears the emblems of some of my favorite, and most compelling, 'self-help' gurus and social scientists -- Daniel Pink, Atul Gawande, Malcolm Gladwell. Were the book to have the steadier hand of a better editor and a bit more cohesion, it might be taken on it's merits, but I couldn't recommend it now.
