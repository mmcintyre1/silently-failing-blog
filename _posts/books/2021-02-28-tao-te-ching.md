I read this after *The Tao of Pooh* thinking it a suitable companion. It's hard not to draw the same conclusions I had for Hoff's novel. As a westerner it feels so antithetical to the categorical imperatives of achievement and progress, the Protestant work ethic of capitalism. Any forays into this sort of passive up is down, black is white mysticism are like trying to press the positive pole of two magnets together. I just can't get the characterization I have of some silicon bro, maybe played by a McConaughey-type, who caught the ground floor at Facebook or something and is now extolling the virtues of Taoism and being one with the universe while making intense eye contact aboard a yacht. Now that I think about it, that might be McConaughey's actual character in *Wolf of Wall Street*...

Anyway, this piece works best for me as a piece of poetry and not so moral code, and there are snippets within about how we choose to pay attention that are universal. The piece has had thousands of years of longevity, so surely it has some important things to say.
