Having read several of Gladwell's books, he is a known commodity. You get an immensely readable book, with interesting anecdotes and a smattering of carefully selected research experiments, all in a compelling package. *Blink* is no exception. Reading through this, I kept thinking, why hasn't he mentioned *Thinking, Fast and Slow*? Both books deal with the rapid cognitions we have unconsciously, the things that happen before we get our grubby storytelling fingers on it and rationalize whatever fired off in our brain. It wasn't until after I finished the book that I looked up when both books were written, and it turns out, *Blink* predates *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by 6 years. Now, Kahneman is a very old man who has been thinking the things he thinks for decades, and has a litany of long-winded and likely academic research behind him, but Gladwell has that sort of pop psych power to define a zeitgeist. Gladwell has practically invented the genre of social sciences for the masses. But if you are looking for the definitive text on rapid cognitions and intuition (although Gladwell never uses that term, claiming it is impinged by emotion), I'd pick up *Thinking, Fast and Slow* and skip over this one.
