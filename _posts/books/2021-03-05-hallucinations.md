Oliver Sacks is an anthropologist of the mind. He weaves biography with neurology, wrapping it all together into a breadth-spanning survey of a topic. He sets his sights on Hallucinations in this work, moving from those phantom and fantastical images caused by failing or failed eyesight to epileptic illusions to autobiography of drug-induced delirium to the culturally shared terrors of sleep paralysis, and a few other stops along the way.

> To live on a day-to-day basis is insufficient for human beings; we need to transcend, transport, escape; we need meaning, understanding, and explanation; we need to see overall patterns in our lives. We need hope, the sense of a future. And we need freedom (or at least the illusion of freedom) to get beyond ourselves, whether with telescopes and microscopes and our ever-burgeoning technology or in states of mind which allow us to travel to other worlds, to transcend our immediate surroundings. We need detachment of this sort as much as we need engagement in our lives.

There is something fundamentally human about seeing things that are untethered from reality. Can religious experience be explained as human's propensity to invent that which is not there? Joan of Arc, for example, was thought to be epileptic, which might explain the fervor her religious convictions if she actually saw the Archangel Michael telling her Charles VII was the rightful king of France.

There is also a section on sleep paralysis. Once or twice a year, I get sleep paralysis. It occurs on those fitful nights half awake and half asleep where time seems to loop back on itself like a ribbon pouring forth from a spool. I appear to myself on my back in my room as a dark figure enters the room. I don't try and move; it doesn't occur to me to move. I am frozen in terror. The figure lurches towards me, raises a weapon over his head, and brings it down violently upon me. I awaken as if I can finally breath again. The experience is so viscerally affecting it inflicts upon me an existential dread lasting months. The mind is a funny instrument of self-enablement and self-destruction. Anyway, its immensely interesting that these phantoms that slouch through our sleep-deprived derangement are shared across cultures and typically take similar forms and almost always involve violence, intrusion, and utter dread. I have never heard a case of sleep paralysis that led to someone walking into their room and their body opening to pour forth candy and sunshine.

That shared culture element is the most interesting bit, and makes me ultimately want not a neurological catalog of hallucinations but rather a cultural and sociological one. Sacks, ever the learned tour guide, alludes to some cultural impacts (the bit about Henry James's ravings being "pure James", and indeed "late James" was wonderful), but for my part the next thing I'd like to read on the subject would be a sociological look at hallucinations.
