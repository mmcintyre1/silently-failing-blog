Potential idea: a dive into what AI taking over the world would look like. Sometimes you hear AI takeover referred to in this hyperbolic terms, like you spin up an EC2 instance to train a model to play chess and 'win at all costs' and this narrow utility function leads to the computer taking over civilization instead of, I don't know, just killing the compute node. We often anthropomorphize these algorithms as if they would react like humans when cornered, but they generally operate within the bounds we set.

Can use this as a learning opportunity to better understand machine learning and AI, and the potential future.

The core is that these techs can be used as weaponry, and they are certainly capable of destabilizing reality like any world-changing tech before (automation removing truck drivers). Smart computer people like Bill Gates and Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are wary, so it's not just random pop psychologists parroting popular buzz words.
